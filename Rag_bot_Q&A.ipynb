              "Document(page_content='The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \\nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \\nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \\nproperty rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \\nproperty rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership,', metadata={'source': '/content/apple_annual_report_2023.pdf', 'page': 5})"
